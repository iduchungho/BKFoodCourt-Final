            Basic example

            The background color is set via prop bg. Default value is light You can set your own color choosing from MDB color palette or by setting a completely custom color via inline CSS, for example style="background-color: #9933CC;". In this case you should set bg property value to none.

            We put a mask on the copyrights section using RGBA code to outstand it. You can change the intensity of its color by manipulating the last value in the RGBA code.
